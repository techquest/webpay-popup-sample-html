        <h2>How to make the redirect page work!</h2>

        Please note that the redirect pages specified in each of the popups will not work.
        
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        This is because WebPay does a POST to those pages and the ones provided here are merely html pages without servser side processing.
        
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        To make it work copy the files in this sample into your web application framework (i.e. PHP, ASP, ASP.Net, JSP etc) and handle the POST in the server code.

		<h2>Hash calculation</h2>		
		 Be sure to recalculate the hash after you have changed the site_redirect_url.
